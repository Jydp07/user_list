User Data

Description
User Data is an application that displays user names and emails fetched from an API. It allows users to search for individuals by their username and view detailed information on a separate page.

Assumptions and Decisions
The app assumes the API endpoint for fetching user data is correctly configured and accessible.
Search functionality is implemented using a simple text input that filters user data in real-time.
A detailed user page is accessible via clicking on a user in the list, with user details displayed.
